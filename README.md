 Oracle SQL projects from training

---------------------------------------------
This is only for educational purposes to showcase what concepts I have learned.
This should not to be used for usage of answers on tests nor should it be used for work that someone else has not done.

What are these projects? How did it get made?
---------------------------------------------
These are currently projects that I am developing from an Oracle SQL course that is still in progress. These bring on great examples of problem solving and utilizing information effectively.

How does it work?
-----------------
These scripts include code to form local tables and queries. They utilize a range of techniques such as selecting specific forms of data, null replacements, conditional statements, etc.

What are the requirements? How do I run it?
-------------------------------------------
I'm currently running these scripts using Oracle SQL Live, but I wouldn't recommend running all of these scripts using that platform since it tends to be very picky about certain commands such as substitutional variables (commands that allow the user to input information). I would recommend running this code on the latest versions of Oracle SQL Express Edition and Oracle SQL Developer.
